# Vue3+Typescript+SCSS Boilerplate and Standard Config (Ready to go! ðŸš€ )

This is a boilerplate starter for a Vue project so i don't keep having to set it up every time i want to start a new project. (my terminal is tired of me invoking the **npm init vue** command) ðŸ˜‚

So i'm trying not to make this overkill, it's pretty straight forward, it's just a boilerplate with a few things i like to have in my projects.

## Installation and Dev

clone the repo or click the use this template button

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/adebayo-moses/vite-vanilla-boilerplate.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd vite-vanilla-boilerplate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start or npm run dev (either works)
```

- Till next time, stay safe and keep coding! ðŸš€
